DOMAIN: Data Analytics

DURATION: 6 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

âœ…INSIGHTS:-

Highest confirmed cases are reported in USA, Brazil, and India.

Countries with higher recovery rates tend to have lower death rates.

Map visualization reveals continent-wise spread concentration.

Side by side bar chart clearly depicts gaps between deaths and recoveries.

#DESCRIPTION:-

In this task, I created an interactive dashboard using Tableau Desktop based on the Covid-19 country-wise latest dataset. The primary objective was to visualise the global impact of Covid-19 and derive meaningful insights to support data-driven decisions.

ðŸ”· Key Visualisations Created:

Interactive Map: Displays total confirmed cases per country with dynamic filtering, helping identify highly affected regions quickly.

Side-by-Side Bar Chart: Compares deaths and recoveries by country, showing gaps between the two metrics for clear understanding of health outcomes.

Scatter Plot: Plots death rate vs recovery rate for all countries, enabling quick identification of outliers and high-risk zones.

KPI Cards: Highlights key indicators such as total confirmed cases, total deaths, total recovered, and global death rate for instant dashboard summary.

ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcome:

This task enhanced my data visualisation and dashboard designing skills. I learnt how to create interactive dashboards using Tableau, integrate multiple visualisations effectively, and derive actionable insights for business or health policy decisions. This practical exposure will strengthen my future data analytics and business intelligence projects.
Tool I Used: Tableau Desktop
